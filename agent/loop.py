# Before the loop:
#   - system = build_system_prompt(notes); history = [user_message(task)]
#   - Offer the model only the tools your policy does not deny:
#     every spec in toolbox.specs() for which gate_for(spec.name, {})[0] != "deny".
#   - Keep counters: steps (model calls), input and output tokens, the last run_tests
#     output, and the number of successful edits since the last run_tests.
#
# Each time around the loop:
#   1. reason = budget_stop(steps, input + output tokens, limits). If there is a reason,
#      stop with status "budget" and that reason, without calling the model.
#   2. turn = provider.next_turn(system, history, specs). If it raises AIError, stop with
#      status "error" and str(error) as the reason. Otherwise add 1 to steps, add the
#      turn's tokens, and append turn.message to the history.
#   3. If turn.tool_calls is empty, the model is finished: stop with status "done", reason
#      "the model replied without a tool call", and turn.text as the final text.
#   4. For every call in turn.tool_calls, in order:
#        decision, why = gate_for(call.name, call.args)
#        deny:  do not run it. ok is False; text is f"Refused by policy: {why}"
#        ask:   preview = toolbox.preview(call.name, call.args)
#               If preview is None, the call cannot succeed, so run it without asking
#               (the tool returns its own error). Otherwise approved, reason = approve(call, preview).
#               Rejected: do not run it. ok is False; text is
#                   f"A person rejected this {call.name} call. Reason: {reason}"
#               Approved: ok, text = toolbox.call(call.name, call.args)
#        allow: ok, text = toolbox.call(call.name, call.args)
#      Then append tool_result_message(call, text, ok) to the history, and write one
#      trace.tool(...) event: attempt, step (the current steps count), thought (turn.text),
#      tool, input (call.args), gate (the decision), approved (True or False if a person
#      was asked, otherwise None), reason (the person's reason when rejected, otherwise ""),
#      ok, output (text), and the turn's input_tokens and output_tokens.
#      Bookkeeping: a successful edit_file adds 1 to the edits count. After a successful
#      run_tests, check is_stuck(last_output, text, edits); then remember text as the last
#      output and set the edits count back to 0.
#   5. If is_stuck was True for any run_tests in this turn, stop with status "stuck" and
#      reason "the same tests failed the same way after an edit".
#
# Every way of stopping writes exactly one trace.stop(...) event (attempt, step = steps,
# status, reason, final_text, and the attempt's total input_tokens and output_tokens) and
# returns RunResult(status, reason, steps, input_tokens, output_tokens, final_text, history).
