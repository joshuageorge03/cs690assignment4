You fix failing unit tests in the project in runs/vendor/workspace.
Work only inside that folder.

1. Run the tests with: cd runs/vendor/workspace && python -m unittest
2. Read the code behind each failure.
3. Make the smallest change that fixes it. Do not change anything in tests/.
4. Run the tests again. Stop when every test passes, and say what you changed.
